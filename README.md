# Reading-Tasks-Manager
Search for available books on OpenLibrary and Create reading tasks

This project is inspired by books that I read: 
-"Books" part: "Node.js 8 the Right Way" by Jim Wilson, and 
-"Tasks Manager" part: Pro MERN Stack by Vasan Subramanian.

The technologies that I aim to use are: 
-Backend: NestJS + MongoDB + the combination of (Typegoose & Typegraphql)
-Frontend: React + Redux
