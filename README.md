# Reading-Tasks-Manager
Search for available books on OpenLibrary and Create reading tasks <br/>
<br/>
This project is inspired by books that I read: <br/>
-"Books" part: "Node.js 8 the Right Way" by Jim Wilson, and <br/>
-"Tasks Manager" part: Pro MERN Stack by Vasan Subramanian. <br/>
<br/>
The technologies that I aim to use are: <br/>
-Backend: NestJS + MongoDB + GraphQL (thanks to @nest/graphql and @nest/mongoose, I don't need Typegoose and Type-graphql anymore) <br/>
-Frontend: React + Redux <br/>
